      <small
        >Ego has no place in the design process. Fail quickly to succeed
        quickly. <br />
        Negative feedback is a gift. Universal design is ethical design. <br />
        Designers are toolmakers. <br />
        Meet people where they are. Be a facilitator. <br />
        Define the problem. Play. There's always more than one solution. <br />
        Empathy is the key to resonance. You are not your user.</small
